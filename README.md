# What Am I?

Whoa, that's pretty deep, don't you think?

The project contains solutions to some Project Euler problems (sometimes 
in more than one way). It is also meant to be a tool for me to explore other elements of
Clojure and progamming in general such as namespaces, project organization and documentation.
